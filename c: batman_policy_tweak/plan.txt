1. Create new object to store deque of Vs, and calculate std_dev(store for all root node children). Also to store Âµ and sig of expQ of root_node children. (should this be N step returns?)
2. in episode, store post reward, Vs, v_unachieved. pass this object to MCTS
3. Create VK function.
4. In MCTS, if we're on the explorer, use this at each 'UCB' stage (looks like 10s per episode) to select child.
5. normalise the nov.
